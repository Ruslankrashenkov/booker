# Contribution guidelines
Thank you for considering contributing to this project! The following are
guidelines you need to follow.

## GPG commit signature verification
To ensure your work comes from a trusted source, you are required to sign your
commits with a GPG key that you generate yourself. You can read
[this article from GitHub] as a guide.

**Commits that do not have a cryptographically verifiable signature will not be
accepted.**

## Contributor License Agreement
In order to give project's owner permission to use and redistribute your
contributions as part of the project, you must accept the
[Individual  Contributor License Agreement] for individuals or
[Entity Contributor License Agreement] for entities.

To accept the CLA, contributors should:
  - declare the agreement with its terms in the comment to the pull request
  - have a line like this with contributor's name and e-mail address in the end
    of every commit message:
    ```Signed-off-by: John Smith <john@example.com>```

The latter can be done with a ```--signoff``` option either to ```git commit```
if you are signing-off a single commit or to ```git rebase``` if you are
signing-off all commits in a pull request.

**Contributions without agreement with the terms of Contributor License
Agreement will not be accepted.**
